# Daily Notes #
### Project Tracking ###
- Project **7069** - No data could be collected due to a number of issues interfering with the collection of data during the entire project; should this be closed out or will work be rescheduled? contact sheryl in project tracking email
- Project **7020** - BNSF recommend closing project with headless summary report and without final report. Cleaning out extraneous files and closing. Ask Derrick if the extra files should be kept due to the lack of a final report.
- Project **7040** - Project postponed till fall because of temperature requirements. Does this mean until the following fall next year? Fall began in september so clarification is needed
- Project **7067** - pending second round of monitoring but the notes annotated it would be completed between the 5th - 15th of october and those dates have already passed. Inquire as to the status.
